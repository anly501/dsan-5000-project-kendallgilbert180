    "### What is dimensionality reduction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. This can be done for a variety of reasons. This can be done to reduce the complexity of a model, to improve the performance of a learning algorithm, or to make it easier to visualize the data [@noauthor_introduction_2017].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many dimensionality reduction techniques and the two I will be using are PCA and T-SNE. PCA stands for principal component analysis and T-SNE stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. To view these dimensionality processes, use the nav bar to navigate to the section you desire.\n",
