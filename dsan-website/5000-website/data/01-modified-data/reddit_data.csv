I’m here with Professor Diane Hildebrandt to talk about waste to energy conversion. AMA!","From floating islands of plastic to mountains of discarded food, humankind seems more and more to be smothering the planet in our own waste. The consequences are devastating, not just for ourselves but for every species sharing the planet with us. The scale of the problem might make it seem insurmountable, but a solution presents itself. The bulk of this waste is in the form of hydrocarbons, which need not be seen as just harmful pollutants; the technology exists to upgrade organic waste into high value products. Gasification readily converts most hydrocarbon waste products into synthesis gas, a mixture of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen which in turn acts as the feedstock for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, yielding valuable products including liquid fuels and pharmaceutical waxes. With the right expertise and technology, we can therefore view most of our waste as a commodity rather than a threat. Here at UNISA’s Materials and Process Synthesis unit we have developed a complete end-to-end process for the conversion of waste into fuel, all mounted within a standard shipping container. We believe this portability is the key to getting this technology where it’s needed most: the sites where waste is produced.

We are professors David Glasser and Diane Hildebrandt, Directors of Materials and Process Synthesis at the University of South Africa and we will be back at **2 pm EDT** to answer your questions. Ask us anything!

I became a research professor at the University of New Hampshire and then moved to the University of Georgia in 2009. 

I have been conducting research on solid waste issues for 19 years with related projects on marine debris since 2001, especially projects related to location and spatial analysis of debris, debris quantification and characterization, and technology/mobile device usage. 

I also specialize in global waste management issues and plastic pollution. In November 2014 I sailed across the Atlantic ocean with 13 other women in eXXpedition to sample land and open ocean plastic and encourage women to enter STEM disciplines. I was principal investigator of the NOAA partnership the Southeast Atlantic Marine Debris Initiative (SEA-MDI) and co-developer of the mobile app Marine Debris Tracker, a tool currently being used in a global citizen science initiative to log marine debris throughout the world.

We will keep an eye on the thread over the coming days and make sure to keep engaging and responding. thanks to all of you and please don't forget to explore radicaloceanfutures.earth!

The latest ocean science shows that we are actually heading towards a fairly dystopian ocean future. In the last few years, the west Antarctic ice sheet has cracked, the Arctic is melting at un unprecedented pace, the oceans have lost more than 2% of their oxygen in the last 50 years and 7% by 2100. Micro plastics have become a major area of concern and are moving through marine food chains…. persistent organic pollutants are being found in deep sea organisms at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. BUT! All hope is not yet lost. The [UN Oceans conference](https://oceanconference.un.org/), kicking off June 5, is a chance to start our move away from the ‘Rime of the last Fisherman’ and towards something else, a different future narrative where the oceans are not just: 'oily, hot, acidic, and full of dead fish'.

The Radical Ocean Futures #ArtScience project is founded on the belief that sometimes science fiction might succeed where scientific papers fall short. It blends art, science and music and merges scientific fact with creative speculation. The heart of the project is four short 'Radical Ocean Futures.' These are scientifically grounded narratives of potential future oceans. Each narrative is supported by both a visual and a musical interpretation to allow multiple entry points and stimulate the imagination. The purpose of this project is to explore tools that can help us to think creatively and imaginatively about our future oceans and assess how unexpected changes, along with human responses to those changes, may play out in a complex world that is, at its heart, surprising.

AMA!","Hi Reddit! Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me. I'm an expert with [NOAA's Marine Debris Program](http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/). 

Last week, I returned from a 33-day NOAA mission to remove marine debris from remote coral reefs, shallow waters, and tiny islands in Hawaii's [Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument](http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/). In total, we removed approximately 57 tons of derelict fishing nets and plastic litter, including one ""super net"" that weighed 11.5 tons.

The monument, which encompasses the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, is one of the largest marine conservation areas in the world. The reefs are some of the healthiest and least disturbed coral reefs remaining and comprise possibly the last large-scale, predator-dominated coral reef ecosystem on the planet. They're also home to more than 7,000 species, including marine mammals, fishes, sea turtles, birds, and invertebrates. Many, including the Hawaiian monk seal, are rare, threatened, or endangered.

Derelict nets and consumer plastics are a pervasive threat to the ocean. Nets entangle animals and damage coral, and marine life can ingest plastic. NOAA has done this removal every year on some scale since 1996, collecting a total of 904 tons.  

I can answer any questions about the mission or talk about the marine debris problem in general. 

I'll be here from 1-3 p.m. EST (5 pm UTC, 10 am PST) to answer your questions.
