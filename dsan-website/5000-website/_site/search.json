    "text": "About Me!\n\n\n,,\nHi! My name is Kendall Gilbert and I am first year student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I recently graduated in May from Elon University where I majored in Media Analytics with minors in Statistics and Business Administration. As a media analytics major, I learned about analyzing, visualing and making sense of media data. A few relevant courses from this program included:\n\nCommunicating Media Insights\nApplied Media Analytics\nMeasuring Media Impact\n\nYou can learn more about my undergraduate major here! Junior year, in my Applied Media Analytics class I was introduced to R for the first time ever. This is where I fell in love with the idea of data analysis and data visualization. You can access my portfolio for this class here!\nFurthermore, my statistics and business classes provided a basic foundation for my transition into the data science world. A few key classes I completed for these minors included:\n\nSurvey Sampling Methods\nStatistical Modeling\nStatistics in Application\n\nTo further prepare for Georgetown’s DSAN Program I took Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus and Multi-Variable Calculus in order to prepare for my transition.\nI am originally from Narragansett Rhode Island but I have lived in California and Colorado as well. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors, hang out with my dogs and travel.\nLiving by the water in Narragansett, I am passionate about preserving our oceans and ensuring their sustainability. This is a major reason why I chose to complete this semester long project on ocean sustainability.\nYou can learn more about me on my Linkedin! Click here!"

This dataset helps proove that people enjoy going to the beach, especially around holidays like fourth of July.\nA few key takeaways from the data visualizations:\n\nPeople visit the beach the most in months June, July and August\nBeach attendance is highest in July and specifically on the fourth\nBeach attendance went down in 2020 as a result of Covid (an outlier)\n\nOverall, I am able to use this data to proove that a lot of people enjoy going to the beach which can help me answer my overall data science question."

This variable is the percentage of policy in a country in a specific year specifically relating to ocean sustainability. I had to clean and tidy this data. You can find this cleaning under the cleaning tab.\nThis model aims to explore whether specific variables are good indicators of the extent to which policies relate to the ocean. It can help identify which aspects or attributes of policies are more strongly correlated with ocean-related policies and which are not. If the model performs well, the findings could have the ability inform data-driven decision-making in policy development specifically with regard to ocean sustainability and conservation efforts.\nThe analysis has the ability to uncover trends or patterns in policy data that can be used for policy assessment, trend analysis, and making informed recommendations."

This variable is the percentage of policy in a country in a specific year specifically relating to ocean sustainability. I had to clean and tidy this data. You can find this here.\nThis model aims to explore whether specific variables are good indicators of the extent to which policies relate to the ocean. It can help identify which aspects or attributes of policies are more strongly correlated with ocean-related policies and which are not. If the model performs well, the findings could have the ability inform data-driven decision-making in policy development specifically with regard to ocean sustainability and conservation efforts.\nThe analysis has the ability to uncover trends or patterns in policy data that can be used for policy assessment, trend analysis, and making informed recommendations."

By analyzing feature importance, researchers can focus on what other countries have done in these areas to promote more effective ocean policy.\nPolicy This model can be a valuable tool for policymakers. It can provide insights into which features have influenced policy decisions in different countries.\nIdentifying Committed Countries: This model shows which countries are committed to policy and the features that have impacted this commitment. By analyzing the predictions it’s possible to determine which countries have actively pursued and implemented policies related to ocean sustainability. This information can be valuable for international cooperation and sharing best practices."

This journal touches upon the need for this connection to effectively ensure long-term sustainable ocean use. The ocean is a crucial part of our world covering 71% of the planet’s surface and 95% of the biosphere. It does many things including climate regulation, water supply and other benefits. (Frazão Santos et al. 2022)\nThe article, “Ocean science research is key for a sustainable future” touches upon the fact that scientists need to work closely with decision-makers and society to get the ocean sustainability back on track. The ocean impacts numerous lives around the world with more than 40% of the global population living in areas within 200km of the ocean. With the drastic increase in the world population throughout the last 50 years - industrial development and humans are negatively impacting the ocean (Visbeck 2018)."

This unhelpful data can be removed without incurring much loss of information.\nBenefits of Feature Selection\n\nShorter training times\nFaster model evaluation\nSimple models are easier to interpret\nHelps with “curse of dimensionality”\nHelps overfitting\nImprove data’s compatibility with a learning model\n\nMain categories of feature selection algorithms that we learned about in class:\n\nWrapper: Algorithms of this type are “wrapped” around a predictive model to score different feature subsets.\nEmbedded: A catch-all group of techniques which perform feature selection as part of the model construction process.\nFilters: An independent step in the feature selection process, conducted before the actual learning algorithm.\n\nWithin my naive bayes modeling I ran the model on non-feature selected data, completed feature selection then ran the model on the feature selected data in order to improove the accuracy of the model.\nTo see the specific steps I took in an effort to imporve these models you can read through the naive bayes tabs for both record and text data."

    "text": "Dimensionality Reduction Overview\nWithin this dimensionality reduction I will build out three different sections. These sections will include dimensionality reduction with PCA, dimensionality reduction with t-SNE and a tab that compares these two techniques.\n\nWhat is dimensionality reduction?\nDimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. This can be done for a variety of reasons. This can be done to reduce the complexity of a model, to improve the performance of a learning algorithm, or to make it easier to visualize the data (“Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction” 2017).\nThere are many dimensionality reduction techniques and the two I will be using are PCA and T-SNE. PCA stands for principal component analysis and T-SNE stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. To view these dimensionality processes, use the nav bar to navigate to the section you desire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction.” 2017.

These values are computed from the covariance matrix and help with determining the principal components.\nPrincipal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These combinations result in new variables (principal components) that are uncorrelated and most of the information within the initial variables is squeezed or compressed into the first components.(“Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Explained  Built In” n.d.).\n\n\nCode\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)\nprint(\"Eigenvalues:\")\nprint(eigenvalues)\nprint(\"Eigenvectors:\")\nprint(eigenvectors)\n\n\nEigenvalues:\n[0.15354681 0.30246714 1.87872189 1.63494736 1.30649672 0.787713\n 0.94969931]\nEigenvectors:\n[[-0.03084694 -0.28856822 -0.06626171  0.1718304  -0.65853337  0.66737184\n   0.05300179]\n [-0.69771318  0.05888819 -0.66508565 -0.19819073  0.12985032  0.10594535\n   0.00494806]\n [-0.03471916 -0.16908509 -0.15650007 -0.0428144  -0.51456224 -0.5373596\n  -0.62477983]\n [-0.06921197  0.67433775 -0.08956347  0.70522824 -0.07998613  0.03219644\n  -0.1663593 ]\n [ 0.70644581  0.02634234 -0.69324472 -0.0425596   0.09906735  0.0859372\n  -0.02532377]\n [-0.08239763 -0.65482314 -0.10477276  0.63696157  0.3682022  -0.09337857\n  -0.05854486]\n [-0.01984967 -0.02126341 -0.17085375  0.15647184 -0.36457294 -0.48733326\n   0.7583352 ]]\n\n\n\n\nChoosing Principal Components\nComputing the eigenvectors and ordering them by their eigenvalues in descending order allow us to find the principal components in order of significance. In this step, we discard low eigen values and form with the remaining ones a matrix of vectors that we call a feature vector.\nPrincipal components represent the directions of the data that explain a maximal amount of variance. Within the code below, I am determing the number of components that maximize the variance.\nWe can think of principal components as new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. They are the new axes that provide the best angle to see and evaluate the data. These principal componenets make it easier to see the difference between variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Sort eigenvalues in descending order\nsorted_indices = np.argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]\nsorted_eigenvalues = eigenvalues[sorted_indices]\n\n# Cumulative explained variance\ncumulative_explained_variance = np.cumsum(sorted_eigenvalues) / np.sum(sorted_eigenvalues)\nplt.plot(range(1, len(cumulative_explained_variance) + 1), cumulative_explained_variance, marker='o', color='skyblue')\nplt.title('Cumulative Explained Variance')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Principal Components')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Explained Variance')\n\ndesired_variance = 0.50 #I want to find the number of variables it takes to reach a variance of 0.5\nnum_components = np.argmax(cumulative_explained_variance &gt;= desired_variance) + 1\nprint(f\"Number of components to capture {desired_variance * 100}% variance: {num_components}\")\n\n\nNumber of components to capture 50.0% variance: 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# PCA with components decided above\npca = PCA(n_components=num_components)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_standardized)\n\n# Scree Plot\nexplained_variance_ratio = pca.explained_variance_ratio_\nprint(\"Explained Variance Ratio for Each Component:\")\nprint(explained_variance_ratio)\nplt.bar(range(1, len(explained_variance_ratio) + 1), explained_variance_ratio, color='skyblue')\nplt.title('Scree Plot')\nplt.xlabel('Principal Components')\nplt.ylabel('Explained Variance Ratio')\nplt.show()\n\n\nExplained Variance Ratio for Each Component:\n[0.26786871 0.23311127]\n\n\n\n\n\nThese principal components are linear combinations of the original features and provide a new coordinate system capturing the most important patterns in the data. As you can see, the first few components capture a majority of the variance.\n\n\nPlotting PCA\nBelow I have created a scatter plot that shows the first two principal components. Currently, you can not infer much from the plot but once I apply clustering we will be able to gather more insights.\n\n\nCode\nplt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], alpha=0.5, color='#A9DFBF')\nplt.title('PCA Scatter Plot')\nplt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')\nplt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')\nplt.show()"

    "text": "PCA and T-SNE are two widely used dimensionality reduction techniques used within the data science world. I have built out tabs specifically describing what each dimensionality technique is capable of achieving. This tab will compare the two.\nPCA is a linear technique that works best with data that has a linear structure. The goal of PCA is to identify the principal components in the data by projecting onto lower dimensions, minimizing variance, and preserving large pairwise distances. PCA may not do the best job with non linear structures.\nT-SNE is a nonlinear technique that focuses on preserving the pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space. T-SNE is concerned with preserving small pairwise distances.\nThe difference between the two of these techniques is evident when producing plots. Furthermore, t-sne is often used just as a visualization technique.\nWhen to USE PCA vs T-SNE\nUse PCA when:\n\nThe data has a linear structure\nYou want to capture global trends\n\nUse t-SNE when:\n\nData has non-linear structures.\nYou want to preserve local relationships and identify clusters\nDataset is moderate in size\n\nSoures Used:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-pca-vs-t-sne/ https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/pca-vs-t-sne-17bcd882bf3d"

It is extremely straight forward and the elbow method helps assure me that 3 clusters will give the best results. I also think that completing k-means on the dimensionality reduced data worked the best. We are able to see three distinctly defined clusters.\nUnfortunately I do not have the true labels for this data so I was unable to see if the clusters coincided with the ground truth.The absence of true labels limits my ability to validate the clusters.\nThis clustering analysis enhanced my understanding on my data set. Clustering has allowed me to summarize my multidimensional dataset into a small number of clusters, simplifying the data making it more easier to communicate. This data can be classified into three clusters (found in K-Means), which I will continue to explore in this project.\nBelow is a table describing the clusters for each variable… to be explored.\n\nclustered_data = data_standardized.groupby('cluster_number_pca')\ncluster_describe = clustered_data.describe()\ncluster_describe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAqua Production (Millions)\nMarine Protected Area (sqkm)\n...\nPCA2\nClusters_f\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\n...\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\ncluster_number_pca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n427.0\n0.033113\n1.061094\n-0.370071\n-0.357156\n-0.322285\n-0.192280\n8.086949\n427.0\n-0.182958\n...\n0.627917\n2.322308\n427.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n1\n77.0\n-0.127284\n0.659682\n-0.368138\n-0.355584\n-0.339992\n-0.206926\n3.833667\n77.0\n0.059060\n...\n-1.703410\n-0.314906\n77.0\n2.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n2\n12.0\n-0.361520\n0.003304\n-0.370071\n-0.362577\n-0.361009\n-0.360014\n-0.355784\n12.0\n6.131303\n...\n5.059737\n5.257986\n12.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n3 rows × 72 columns"

Because points form clusters / groups it can be inferred that there are patterns in the high dimensional data.\nIt’s important to note that the interpretation of a t-SNE plot is qualitative not quantitative. The distances between points within the t-sne plots above do not have a meaningful scale, the goal is to visualize the inherent structures and relationships in the data since that is unavailable in the 7 dimensional space.\n\nCompare with PCA\nI provided the PCA scatter plot below to illustrate the differences between the two plots. I think that both t-sne and pca have beneficial results. T-sne shows that some countries stay close to eachother in a seven dimension space and some do not. PCA tells us that there are some rows within the seven dimensional space that are extreme outliers. This make sense as PCA tends to capture global trends.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot PCA results\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=y, cmap='Blues')\nplt.title('PCA')\n\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'PCA')"

I have chosen to use 7 clusters. I will later on implement code to help me achieve the optimal number of clusters. I have implemented k-means on my dimensionality reduced data (PCA).\nI have provided comments in my code to help readers understand what is being completed.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\nreduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data_standardized)\ndata_standardized['PCA1'] = reduced_data[:, 0]\ndata_standardized['PCA2'] = reduced_data[:, 1]\n\n# Performing K-means!!\nkmeans_pca = KMeans(n_clusters=7, random_state=42, n_init=10)\nkmeans_pca.fit(reduced_data)\ndata_standardized['cluster_number_pca'] = kmeans_pca.labels_\n\n# Plot\nplt.scatter(data_standardized['PCA1'], data_standardized['PCA2'], c=data_standardized['cluster_number_pca'], cmap='viridis', marker='o', s=50)\nplt.title('K-means Clustering in PCA Space')\nplt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')\nplt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')\n\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'Principal Component 2')\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the plot above, you can see that the dimensionality reduced data has beed placed into seven different clusters. This plot is not very informative because we do not actually know what country each plot is. Because of this I have utilized plotly to make an interactive plot.\nK-Means with 7 Clusters and an Interactive Plot\nTo see if dots are from the same country you can use your cursor to see each more info on each plot.\n*Unfortunately I have not been able how to transform the standardized and encoded Country labels back to text** TBD\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nhover_data = data_standardized[['Country']] #This can be a way for readers to see if data in clusters are coming from same country \n\ndata_standardized['Country'] = data_standardized['Country'].apply(lambda x: f'{x:.3f}')\n\nfig = px.scatter(data_standardized, x='PCA1', y='PCA2', color='cluster_number_pca', hover_data=hover_data,\n                 labels={'cluster_number_pca': 'Cluster Number', 'PCA1': 'Principal Component 1', 'PCA2': 'Principal Component 2'})\n\nfig.update_layout(title='K-means Clustering in PCA Space with 7 Clusters', xaxis_title='Principal Component 1', yaxis_title='Principal Component 2')\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nImproving K-Means\nK-Means clustering can be improved through hyperparameter tuning. Specifically I will look at inertia and distortion plots to help improve this clustering algorithm.\n\n\nInertia and Distortion Table\nInertia and distortion can help us find the number of clusters we want to use. Inertia measures how well a dataset was clustered by the k-means algorithm. Inertia is calculated by measuring the distance between each data point and its centroid, squaring this distance, and summing these squares across one cluster. The k-means algorithm tries to minimize distortion. Distoriton is the sum of the squared distances between each observation vector and its dominating centroid.\nAn ideal k-means algorithm has low inertia and distortion.\n\n\nCode\n# This code find the inertia and distorition for the number of clusters ranging 1 -10\nnum_clusters_list = []\ninertia_list = []\ndistortion_list = []\n\nfor num_clusters in range(1, 10):\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=0, n_init=10)\n    kmeans.fit(data_standardized)\n    inertia = kmeans.inertia_\n    num_clusters_list.append(num_clusters)\n    inertia_list.append(inertia)\n\n    distortion = sum(np.min(kmeans.transform(data_standardized), axis=1)) / data_standardized.shape[0]\n    distortion_list.append(distortion)\n\nresult_df = pd.DataFrame({'Cluster': num_clusters_list,'Distortion': distortion_list, 'Inertia': inertia_list})\nresult_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nDistortion\nInertia\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n3.278359\n7428.818752\n\n\n1\n2\n2.574312\n5618.145658\n\n\n2\n3\n2.318994\n4019.721700\n\n\n3\n4\n1.911911\n2670.665313\n\n\n4\n5\n1.714107\n2280.490226\n\n\n5\n6\n1.605240\n1858.550157\n\n\n6\n7\n1.482697\n1471.965095\n\n\n7\n8\n1.369952\n1213.225255\n\n\n8\n9\n1.264832\n1088.755662\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElbow Plots\nWithin this section you will see two plots. The plot on the left shows how the distortion changes when the clusters increase and the plot on the right shows how the inertia changes when clusters increase. Elbow plots help us figure out how many clusters we should be using.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))\n\n# Plot for Distortion\nax[0].plot(result_df['Cluster'], result_df['Distortion'], marker='o', color='#A9DFBF')\nax[0].set_title('Distortion vs. Number of Clusters')\nax[0].set_xlabel('Number of Clusters')\nax[0].set_ylabel('Distortion')\n\n# Plot for Inertia\nax[1].plot(result_df['Cluster'], result_df['Inertia'], marker='o', color='skyblue')\nax[1].set_title('Inertia vs. Number of Clusters')\nax[1].set_xlabel('Number of Clusters')\nax[1].set_ylabel('Inertia')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the plots above the distortion and inertia is very high when the number of clusters are low. In order to find the optimal number of clusters we must look for the elbow. The elbow appears to be at 3 for distortion and 4 for inertia. Knowing this, I will perform k-means again, although this time I will use 3 clusters.\n\n\nK-Means - 2\nI am now going to repeat k-means but when three clusters. This is because I have found the optimal number of clusters above using elbow plots. The table below illustrates how k-means has assigned each row with a cluster number under (cluster_number).\n\n\nScatter Plot\n\n\nCode\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\ndata_standardized['PCA1'] = reduced_data[:, 0]\ndata_standardized['PCA2'] = reduced_data[:, 1]\n\nkmeans_pca = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=10)\nkmeans_pca.fit(reduced_data)\ndata_standardized['cluster_number_pca'] = kmeans_pca.labels_\ndata_standardized.tail(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAqua Production (Millions)\nMarine Protected Area (sqkm)\nInventions (number)\nInstruments (number)\nFishing Exports (Millions)\nValue\nCountry\nPCA1\nPCA2\ncluster_number_pca\n\n\n\n\n511\n-0.358976\n-0.218847\n-0.326903\n-0.616921\n0.228323\n0.828407\n-1.209\n0.681468\n-0.537140\n0\n\n\n512\n-0.281627\n-0.028119\n-0.278457\n1.866162\n-0.505692\n1.956863\n-1.128\n1.042013\n-2.720060\n1\n\n\n513\n0.096134\n-0.211732\n0.098324\n-0.865229\n0.653408\n-0.412848\n-1.048\n0.428745\n0.623107\n0\n\n\n514\n-0.332200\n-0.017895\n-0.326903\n2.114471\n0.723741\n3.356415\n-0.967\n2.207933\n-3.390646\n1\n\n\n515\n-0.360655\n0.834997\n-0.333362\n-0.120304\n1.695861\n3.040295\n-0.886\n2.825434\n-1.366719\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhover_data = data_standardized[['Country']]\n\nfig = px.scatter(data_standardized, x='PCA1', y='PCA2', color='cluster_number_pca', hover_data=hover_data,\n                 labels={'cluster_number_pca': 'Cluster Number', 'PCA1': 'Principal Component 1', 'PCA2': 'Principal Component 2'})\n\nfig.update_layout(title='K-means Clustering in PCA Space with 3 Clusters', xaxis_title='Principal Component 1', yaxis_title='Principal Component 2')\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs you can see there are now three well defined clusters. It is interesting to note that the yellow seems to contain outliers within the data set.\nBelow, I ran K-Means again although I changed the X axis to Marine Protected Area and Y axis to Fishing Exports.\n\n\nScatter Plot with Features\n\n\nCode\nkmeans_pca = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=10)\nkmeans_pca.fit(data_standardized)\ndata_standardized['Clusters_f'] = kmeans_pca.labels_\n\n\nhover_data = data_standardized[['Country']]\n\nfig = px.scatter(data_standardized, x='Marine Protected Area (sqkm)', y='Fishing Exports (Millions)', color='Clusters_f', hover_data=hover_data\n                 )\n\nfig.update_layout(title='K-means Clustering with 2 Features', xaxis_title='Marine Protected Area', yaxis_title='Fishing Exports')\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nRunning clustering on specific features has the power to be beneficial in seeing how the data is being grouped together.

The main idea is that for each point within a cluster, the neighberhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points. DBSCAN works better for data that contains irregularities.\nThe parameters for DBSCAN are EPS and MinPts. EPS is a distance measure used to locate points in the neighberhood of any point. MinPts is the minimum number of points clustered together for a region to be considered dense.\nSo why use DBSCAN over K-Means? Often times k-means may cluster loosely related observations together. Every observation becomes part of a cluster eventually in k-means. This problem is reduced in dbscan as a result of the way dbscan works.\nData scientists sometimes prefer dbscan as you do not have to specify the number of clusters. (“DBSCAN Clustering in ML  Density Based Clustering” 2019)\n\n\nHierarchical Clustering\nHierarchical clustering can be divided into two types\n\nAgglomerative: Each object is its own cluster. The clusters are merged step by step until a single cluster remains. At the end of the cluster merging process, a cluster containing all the elements is formed.\nDivisive: Opposite of the agglomerative method. In the beginning, all objects are considered in a single cluster. The division process is performed until each object forms a different cluster. The cluster division or splitting procedure is carried out according to some principles that maximum distance between neighboring objects in the cluster.\n\nAgglomerative is the preffered method.\nWithin hierarchical clustering clusters are visually represeneted in a hierarchical tree called a dendrogram. This method is sometimes preferred as you do not need to specify the number of clusters and the data is easily summarized into a hierarchy using dendrograms.\nKeep scrolling to see each clustering method on my data set!"

We are able to see three distinctly defined clusters.\nCan you make connections between the optimal cluster predictions, after parameter tuning, with any of the labels in the data set. Do they coincide? Why or why not?\nUnfortunately I do not have the true labels for this data so I was unable to see if the clusters coincided with the ground truth.

Specifically I will look at inertia and distortion plots.\n\nInertia and Distortion Table\nInertia and distortion can help us find the number of clusters we want to use. Inertia is measures how well a dataset was clustered by the k-means algorithm. Inertia is calculated by measuring the distance between each data point and its centroid, squaring this distance, and summing these squares across one cluster. The k-means algorithm tries to minimize distortion. Distoriton is the sum of the squared distances between each observation vector and its dominating centroid.\nAn ideal k-means algorithm has low inertia and distortion.\n\n\nCode\n# This code find the inertia and distorition for the number of clusters ranging 1 -10\nnum_clusters_list = []\ninertia_list = []\ndistortion_list = []\n\nfor num_clusters in range(1, 10):\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=0, n_init=10)\n    kmeans.fit(data_standardized)\n    inertia = kmeans.inertia_\n    num_clusters_list.append(num_clusters)\n    inertia_list.append(inertia)\n\n    distortion = sum(np.min(kmeans.transform(data_standardized), axis=1)) / data_standardized.shape[0]\n    distortion_list.append(distortion)\n\nresult_df = pd.DataFrame({'Cluster': num_clusters_list,'Distortion': distortion_list, 'Inertia': inertia_list})\nresult_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nDistortion\nInertia\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n3.278368\n7428.853456\n\n\n1\n2\n2.574338\n5618.204302\n\n\n2\n3\n2.319021\n4019.776723\n\n\n3\n4\n1.911938\n2670.702230\n\n\n4\n5\n1.714138\n2280.528928\n\n\n5\n6\n1.605272\n1858.588267\n\n\n6\n7\n1.482730\n1472.000526\n\n\n7\n8\n1.369983\n1213.250800\n\n\n8\n9\n1.264855\n1088.774512\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElbow Plots\nWithin this section you will see two plots. The plot on the left shows how the distortion changes when the clusters increase and the plot on the right shows how the inertia changes when clusters increase. Elbow plots help us figure out how many clusters we should be using.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))\n# Plot for Distortion\nax[0].plot(result_df['Cluster'], result_df['Distortion'], marker='o', color='#A9DFBF')\nax[0].set_title('Distortion vs. Number of Clusters')\nax[0].set_xlabel('Number of Clusters')\nax[0].set_ylabel('Distortion')\n\n# Plot for Inertia\nax[1].plot(result_df['Cluster'], result_df['Inertia'], marker='o', color='skyblue')\nax[1].set_title('Inertia vs. Number of Clusters')\nax[1].set_xlabel('Number of Clusters')\nax[1].set_ylabel('Inertia')\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the plots above the distortion and inertia is very high when the number of clusters are low. In order to find the optimal number of clusters we must look for the elbow. The elbow appears to be at 3 for distortion and 4 for inertia. Knowing this, I will perform k-means again, although this time I will use 3 clusters.\n\n\nK-Means (2)\nI am now going to repeat k-means but when three clusters. This is because I have found the optimal number of clusters above using elbow plots.\n\n\nCode\nk = 3 #number of optimal clusters\nkmeans = KMeans(k, random_state=42)\nkmeans.fit(data_standardized)\ndata_standardized['cluster_number'] = kmeans.labels_\ndata_standardized\n\n\n/Users/kendallgilbert/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:1412: FutureWarning: The default value of `n_init` will change from 10 to 'auto' in 1.4.

Out of these three methods I prefer k-means. It is extremely straight forward and the elbow method helps assure me that 3 clusters will give the best results. I also think that completing k-means on the dimensionality reduced data worked the best. We are able to see three distinctly defined clusters.\nUnfortunately I do not have the true labels for this data so I was unable to see if the clusters coincided with the ground truth. The absence of true labels limits my ability to validate the clusters.\nThis clustering analysis enhanced my understanding on my data set. Clustering has allowed me to summarize my multidimensional dataset into a small number of clusters, simplifying the data making it more easier to communicate. This data can be classified into three clusters (found in K-Means), which I will continue to explore in this project.\nBelow is a table describing the clusters for each feature.\n\n\nCode\ncolumns_to_exclude = ['PCA1', 'PCA2']\ndata_for_clustering = data_standardized.drop(columns=columns_to_exclude)\nclustered_data = data_for_clustering.groupby('Clusters_f')\ncluster_describe = clustered_data.describe()\ncluster_describe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAqua Production (Millions)\nMarine Protected Area (sqkm)\nInventions (number)\nInstruments (number)\nFishing Exports (Millions)\nValue\ncluster_number_pca\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\nClusters_f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n427.0\n0.033113\n1.061094\n-0.370071\n-0.357156\n-0.322285\n-0.192280\n8.086949\n427.0\n-0.182958\n0.181332\n-0.280220\n-0.273972\n-0.251229\n-0.189612\n0.953724\n427.0\n0.048358\n1.087514\n-0.333362\n-0.313984\n-0.255849\n-0.070688\n8.737860\n427.0\n-0.221489\n7.982990e-01\n-1.113538\n-0.865229\n-0.368613\n0.128004\n2.611087\n427.0\n-0.175076\n0.593872\n-0.768175\n-0.598041\n-0.356520\n0.078319\n2.864188\n427.0\n-0.361224\n2.816619e-01\n-0.751243\n-0.596974\n-0.412848\n-0.176825\n0.828407\n427.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n1\n12.0\n-0.361520\n0.003304\n-0.370071\n-0.362577\n-0.361009\n-0.360014\n-0.355784\n12.0\n6.131303\n1.589411\n3.238825\n5.027287\n6.373157\n7.614396\n8.064208\n12.0\n0.337857\n0.410121\n-0.000183\n0.073342\n0.212462\n0.406779\n1.375166\n12.0\n-1.113538\n2.319180e-16\n-1.113538\n-1.113538\n-1.113538\n-1.113538\n-1.113538\n12.0\n4.825392\n1.125568\n1.782048\n4.753901\n5.213789\n5.550297\n5.670186\n12.0\n-0.751243\n2.319180e-16\n-0.751243\n-0.751243\n-0.751243\n-0.751243\n-0.751243\n12.0\n2.0\n0.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n2\n77.0\n-0.127284\n0.659682\n-0.368138\n-0.355584\n-0.339992\n-0.206926\n3.833667\n77.0\n0.059060\n0.334970\n-0.277454\n-0.203746\n-0.043971\n0.171109\n1.075947\n77.0\n-0.320819\n0.020406\n-0.333362\n-0.333362\n-0.326903\n-0.320443\n-0.233241\n77.0\n1.401793\n8.689397e-01\n-0.616921\n1.121237\n1.617854\n1.866162\n2.611087\n77.0\n0.218867\n0.855564\n-0.735585\n-0.546890\n0.109530\n1.067341\n1.768363\n77.0\n2.120226\n9.839036e-01\n0.371053\n1.479130\n1.956863\n3.040295\n3.356415\n77.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow I have created a bar chart to establish the max value for each feature in each cluster based off of the clustering completed on the ORIGINAL FEATURES.

The lower values across multiple features may indicate areas where improvement or development could be considered.\nIf I had more time I would do more EDA on the clusters.\nWill expand as I understand my data better"

    "text": "Decision Tree Classification\nThe decision tree algorithm works by recursively splitting the data based on the features (attributes) to create a tree-like structure. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a particular feature, and each leaf node represents the class label (1,2,3,4,5). 1 being least sustainable and 5 being most sustainable. The final leaf node reached determines the predicted class for that tuple.\n\nImporting Libraries and Data\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.tree import plot_tree\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, recall_score, precision_score\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_text\n\n\n# Loading data\ntrees = pd.read_csv(\"/Users/kendallgilbert/dsan-5000-project-kendallgilbert180/dsan-website/5000-website/data/01-modified-data/nb_record.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCreating Bins\nI created five bins for my target variable.\nTarget - Percentage of Policy out of all policy in a year relating to ocean sustainability.

After setting these hyperparamters, the random forest classifier can be used to solve for regression or classification problems.\nTo learn more about random forests visit here\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# Specifying hyperparameters \nrf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(\n    n_estimators=100,\n    criterion=\"entropy\",\n    min_samples_split=2,\n    min_samples_leaf=1,\n    max_depth=None,\n    random_state=1\n)\n\n# Train Random Forest Classifier\nrf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_rf_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluation\nrf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_rf_pred)\nprint(\"Random Forest Accuracy:\", rf_accuracy)\nrf_classification_rep = classification_report(y_test, y_rf_pred)\nprint(\"Random Forest Classification Report:\\n\", rf_classification_rep)\n\n\nRandom Forest Accuracy: 0.967741935483871\nRandom Forest Classification Report:\n               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           1       0.98      1.00      0.99       128\n           2       0.83      0.62      0.71         8\n           3       1.00      0.67      0.80         3\n           4       1.00      0.67      0.80         3\n           5       0.93      1.00      0.96        13\n\n    accuracy                           0.97       155\n   macro avg       0.95      0.79      0.85       155\nweighted avg       0.97      0.97      0.96       155\n\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Confusion Matrix\n\n\nCode\nrf_conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_rf_pred)\ndisp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=rf_conf_matrix, display_labels=sorted(y.unique()))\ndisp.plot(cmap='Blues', values_format='d')\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix for Random Forest')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, this model does a very good job predicting Bin 1.

    "text": "Results and Conclusions\nOverall the decision tree and random forest models have very high accuracy. Although, this may be due to the large number of countries that fall within Bin 1 - as shown by the class distribution.\nDecision trees are a very intuitive machine learning model. This model allows readers to see what attributes are taken into account when classifying a tuple as sustainable. The decision tree visualization allows us to see which features are most important in determining the sustainability category.\nA few interesting things to point out:\n\nThe top most condition is based off of Policy Instruments. Policy Instruments are the amount of policy that has been released per year relating to sustainability (not just ocean sustainabiloty) by country.\nThe random forest algorithm preformed better than the classification decision tree!"

For example I learned:\n\nThe number of environmental technology inventions increased around 2010 and since then has decreased\nThe number of policy instruments are slowly increasing each year\nAquaculture Production is increasing\nAquaculture production is highest in the United States, New Zealand and Australia\nMarine Protected Area is steadily increasing each year.\nMarine Protected Area is highest in China\nThe predicted average tonnes of plastic is steadily increasing until 2060\n\nIt was also beneficial to look at the five number summaries for each variable to start taking note of any outliers or strange numbers.\nWithin the multivariate EDA I explored correlations and relationships between variables. I did this through the use of Pearson correlation and scatter plots. From this EDA I was able to understand that the correlations within my dataset were relatively low besides the strong correlation between Marine Protected Area and Fishing Exports.\nOverall, EDA is a crucial step in the data science process that helped set my project up for success. I learned about my data which allowed me to successfully complete my models in the future. EDA helped me explore questions like what is currently being done to help ocean sustainability, the correlation between ocean sustainability movements and how sustainability is important to marine life and the wellness of communities.

The model can help identify which aspects or attributes of policies are more strongly correlated with ocean-related policies and which are not. If the model performed well, the findings could have the ability to inform data-driven decision-making in policy development specifically with regard to ocean sustainability and conservation efforts. My model had a decent accuracy score at 70%. This model has the ability to help researchers find patterns, understand feature impact, and use it as a resource when coming up with policy and identifying committed countries.\nFurthermore, I completed a Naive Bayes model on text data. The ultimate goal of this model was to train a model to explore whether reddit posts regarding ocean sustainability and plastic pollution are good indicators of what sub reddit class they come from. This model had a 44% testing accuracy so it did not perform as well as the record data naive bayes. This model allows readers to gain insights into the prevalence of discussions related to ocean sustainability and plastic pollution across various subreddits as well as track trends and changes in the discussions related to ocean sustainability and plastic pollution over time.\nNaive Bayes helped me achieve my objective of answering questions like what is being done to help ocean sustainability and what is working more so than not."

The mean squared error was very large, although completing random forests decreased the mean squared error significantly.\nOverall, decision trees helped us understand import features like Marine Protected Area and policy instruments and their ability to help researchers predict how much a country will implement policy relating to ocean sustainability."

    "text": "Wrap Up\nOverall, this project allowed me to dive into data from a wealth of countries regarding ocean sustainability. Data science tools allowed me to understand key things like what features have an impact on ocean sustainability, what will happen in the future if sustainability is ignored and what is currently being done that helps countries (that may be unknown).\nThe most prominent features that have an impact on overall ocean sustainability throughout the world are marine protected areas, fishing exports and policy instruments. An increase in marine protected areas results in an increase in fishing exports. Furthermore, the amount of policy instruments (policy related to environment) also has an impact on ocean sustainability.\nWithout the machine learning algorithms that I have implemented on this data throughout the course of this semester I would be unaware of what features need to be looked at more closely.\nI also was able to learn about what is currently being done and how it has the power to help a country’s overall attempt at ocean sustainability.\nIn the future, I would love to look more closely at marine protected area data and explore the impact marine protected area has on a countries overall sustainability."
