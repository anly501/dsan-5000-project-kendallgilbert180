    "text": "Introduction\nHi! My name is Kendall Gilbert and I am first year student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I recently graduated in May from Elon University where I majored in Media Analytics with minors in Statistics and Business Administration. As a media analytics major, I learned a lot about analyzing, visualing and making sense of media data. A few relevant courses from this program included:\n\nCommunicating Media Insights\nApplied Media Analytics\nMeasuring Media Impact\n\nYou can learn more about my undergraduate major here! Junior year, in my Applied Media Analytics class I was introduced to R for the first time ever. This is where I fell in love with the idea of data manipulation and data visualization. You can access my portfolio for this class here!\nFurthermore, my statistics and business classes provided a basic foundation for my transition into the data science world. A few key classes I completed for these minors included:\n\nSurvey Sampling Methods\nStatistical Modeling\nStatistics in Application\n\nTo further prepare for Georgetown’s DSAN Program I took Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus and Multi-Variable Calculus in order to prepare for my transition.\nI am originally from Narragansett Rhode Island but I have lived in California and Colorado as well. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors, hang out with my dogs and travel.\nMy dream one day is to work as a data scientist for a company I am passionate about.\nYou can learn more about me on my Linkedin!

By the end of the project, I will be able to support my hypothesis through data exploration and clearly display the impact these teams are having on regions.\nThe analysis will also provide a tool for organizations, local governments and developers to use when deciding if and how to invest in a minor league sports team."

The results of the extensive research is non positive with minimal negative results, and the researcher makes it clear that, “considerable work is still necessary to refine our understanding of the effects of minor league sports on local economies.” The publication also mentions that the positive impact of minor league sports may not be just related to baseball but other sports like hockey and soccer (Agha 2013). My research will aim to further pursue the impact of minor league sports.\nThe article, “Minor League Baseball: Risks and Potential Benefits for Communities Large and Small.” talks about the potential risks of investing in a minor league baseball stadium. The article homes in on the point that the risks can outweigh the benefits if approached correctly. These minor league baseball stadiums are not always bringing in large quantities of money but they are improving the communities quality of life and may be worth it from a public policy standpoint. Furthermore, this article talks about where stadiums will be most beneficial. For example, a team must be playing more than 70 games (Johnson 1998)."
