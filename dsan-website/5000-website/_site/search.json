Specifically, minor league baseball, basketball, soccer, football and ice hockey data.\nI will look at the data behind the impact minor league professional sports teams have on regional areas and communities. This project analyzes data from a majority of minor league sports in the United States including minor league baseball, basketball, soccer, football and ice hockey and data about community benefits The analysis seeks to answer questions such as:\n\n“Do minor league sports teams create jobs for a community?”\n“Are communities with minor league sports teams healthier and happier?”\n“Should local governments invest in minor league team facilities and players? If so, how much?”\n\nI will be looking closely at minor league sports’ economic impact on an area as well as their impact on the surrounding community as a whole. I will also analyze the challenges and setbacks that come alongside these teams when it comes to the economy and community and if they stand in the way of an overall positive impact these teams could have on a specific region.\nThis is important because minor league sports play a role in numerous people’s lives but no one stops to think about the impact these teams are having overall for a community. For example, there are 130 Minor League Baseball teams and only 30 Major League Baseball teams (“About Minor League Baseball” n.d.) - this means that there are 75% more Minor League teams than Major League. These teams are in theory impacting the surrounding regions in more ways than one that often goes unquantified and a closer look will help organizations and governments decide whether to invest in local teams, how much and how so.\nThis portfolio will explain, analyze and visualize in a clear and concise manner the impact these minor league teams are having on a specific region with data. Within this website, the raw data, cleaned data, visualizations and analysis will be in one place and easy to explore for investors and decision makers such as a development group deciding whether to place a minor league team in a certain location and the type of facility to provide to players and fans.\nSignificant research has been done analyzing the impact minor league baseball has on a region, but I have yet to come across a wealth of research that conveys the impact other minor league sports are having on a community. My project will target all minor league sports team data in the US, not just baseball."

    "text": "Introduction\nHi! My name is Kendall Gilbert and I am first year student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I recently graduated in May from Elon University where I majored in Media Analytics with minors in Statistics and Business Administration. As a media analytics major, I learned a lot about analyzing, visualing and making sense of media data. A few relevant courses from this program included:\n\nCommunicating Media Insights\nApplied Media Analytics\nMeasuring Media Impact\n\nYou can learn more about my undergraduate major here! Junior year, in my Applied Media Analytics class I was introduced to R for the first time ever. This is where I fell in love with the idea of data manipulation and data visualization. You can access my portfolio for this class here!\nFurthermore, my statistics and business classes provided a basic foundation for my transition into the data science world. A few key classes I completed for these minors included:\n\nSurvey Sampling Methods\nStatistical Modeling\nStatistics in Application\n\nTo further prepare for Georgetown’s DSAN Program I took Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus and Multi-Variable Calculus in order to prepare for my transition.\nI am originally from Narragansett Rhode Island but I have lived in California and Colorado as well. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors, hang out with my dogs and travel.\nMy dream one day is to work as a data scientist for a company I am passionate about.\nYou can learn more about me on my Linkedin!

The results of the extensive research is non positive with minimal negative results, and the researcher makes it clear that, “considerable work is still necessary to refine our understanding of the effects of minor league sports on local economies.” The publication also mentions that the positive impact of minor league sports may not be just related to baseball but other sports like hockey and soccer (Agha 2013). My research will aim to further pursue the impact of minor league sports.\nThe article, “Minor League Baseball: Risks and Potential Benefits for Communities Large and Small.” talks about the potential risks of investing in a minor league baseball stadium. The article homes in on the point that the risks can outweigh the benefits if approached correctly. These minor league baseball stadiums are not always bringing in large quantities of money but they are improving the communities quality of life and may be worth it from a public policy standpoint. Furthermore, this article talks about where stadiums will be most beneficial. For example, a team must be playing more than 70 games (Johnson 1998)."
