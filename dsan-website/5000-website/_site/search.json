    "text": "Hi! My name is Kendall Gilbert and I am first year student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I recently graduated in May from Elon University where I majored in Media Analytics with minors in Statistics and Business Administration. As a media analytics major, I learned a lot about analyzing, visualing and making sense of media data. A few relevant courses from this program included:\n\nCommunicating Media Insights\nApplied Media Analytics\nMeasuring Media Impact\n\nYou can learn more about my undergraduate major here! Junior year, in my Applied Media Analytics class I was introduced to R for the first time ever. This is where I fell in love with the idea of data manipulation and data visualtion. You can access my portfolio for this class here!\nFurthermore, my statistics and business classes provided a basic foundation for my transition into the data science world. A few key classes I completed for these minors included:\n\nSurvey Sampling Methods\nStatistical Modeling\nStatistics in Application\n\nTo further prepare for Georgetown’s DSAN Program I took Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus and Multi-Variable Calculus in order to prepare for my transition.\nI am originally from Narragansett Rhode Island but I have lived in California and Colorado as well. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors, hang out with my dogs and travel.\nMy dream one day is to work as a data scientist for a company I am passionate about.\nYou can learn more about me on my Linkedin!
