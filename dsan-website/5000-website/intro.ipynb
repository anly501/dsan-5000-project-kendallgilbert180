    "Ocean sustainability is the approach taken to maintain and manage the services our world's oceans provide. The ocean is an essential part of our ecosystem and benefits many aspects of people's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will look at the data behind ocean sustainability. This semester-long project will analyze data touching upon the necessity of ocean sustainability, how the ocean benefits us, the negative impacts humans have on ocean sustainability, the benefits of investing in ocean sustainability and what is currently being done to help sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis seeks to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the Importance of Ocean Sustainability?\n",
    "- What Negative Impacts Do Humans Have on Ocean Sustainability?\n",
    "- What Is Currently Being Done for Ocean Sustainability?\n",
    "\n",

    "Ocean sustainability is the approach required to manage our oceans and the services they provide.  Ocean-related industries in many countries have expanded with insufficient consideration for the environment, risking the natural resources and the essential marine ecosystem services on which economies and people’s well-being depend. The ocean is our planet's largest ecosystem, with over a million species and scientists have yet to explore a majority of this ecosystem [@martin_oceans_nodate].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists and policymakers have attempted to improve ocean sustainability development, but often the management needed to achieve these goals are unclear. This is the case for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 for the world’s oceans [@reimer_benefits_2021]. Research has been completed in an effort to attempt to provide guidance to SDG 14. This is a good start towards the world's effort towards ocean sustainability, although significant work is needed to be done. Countries around the world are implementing a variety of efforts both minimal and large in an attempt to sustain the world's oceans.\n",

    "## **Hypothesis / Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ocean sustainability has an impact on our world and is necessary for the future health of our world's oceans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I want this project to clearly and concisely display the need for ocean sustainability in addition to what is being done and how it has helped so far. By the end of the project, I will be able to support my hypothesis through data exploration and modeling and clearly display the impact of ocean sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will act as a tool for organizations, local governments and developers to use when deciding if and how to invest in ocean sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Additional Questions Being Addressed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My project will also be able to address questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the importance of ocean sustainability?\n",
    "- Why is ocean sustainability necessary for the future of our world?\n",
    "- What negative impacts do humans have on ocean sustainability?\n",
    "- What Is currently being done to help ocean sustainability?\n",
    "- What are the benefits of investing in ocean sustainability?\n",
    "- How does the ocean benefit us?\n",
    "- Why is the ocean important to the economy?\n",
    "- Why is the ocean important to marine life?\n",
    "- How does the ocean contribute to the wellness of communities?\n",
    "- What will happen if we do not invest time in ocean sustainability?\n",

    "According to the article, “A sustainable Ocean for All” the ocean and humans are deeply interconnected and this connection must be understood in order to achieve ocean sustainability. This journal touches upon the need for this connection to effectively ensure long-term sustainable ocean use. The ocean is a crucial part of our world covering 71% of the planet's surface and 95% of the biosphere. It does many things including climate regulation, water supply and other benefits. [@frazao_santos_sustainable_2022]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The article, “Ocean science research is key for a sustainable future” touches upon the fact that scientists need to work closely with decision-makers and society to get the ocean sustainability back on track. The ocean impacts numerous lives around the world with more than 40% of the global population living in areas within 200km of the ocean. With the drastic increase in the world population throughout the last 50 years - industrial development and humans are negatively impacting the ocean [@visbeck_ocean_2018].\n",
