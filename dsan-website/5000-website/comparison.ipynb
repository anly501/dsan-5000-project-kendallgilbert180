    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a linear technique that works best with data that has a linear structure. It seeks to identify the underlying principal components in the data by projecting onto lower dimensions, minimizing variance, and preserving large pairwise distances. Read our Principal Component Analysis (PCA) tutorial to understand the inner working of the algorithms with R examples. \n",

    "But, t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that focuses on preserving the pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space. t-SNE is concerned with preserving small pairwise distances whereas, PCA focuses on maintaining large pairwise distances to maximize variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, PCA preserves the variance in the data, whereas t-SNE preserves the relationships between data points in a lower-dimensional space, making it quite a good algorithm for visualizing complex high-dimensional data. "
